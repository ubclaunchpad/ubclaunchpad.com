Most frequently updated website values (recruitment status, teams, etc.) on the [UBC Launch Pad website](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new) can be updated by changing the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/src/config.ts). This site describes the different settings available and guidance on what each value should be.

To make an edit, simply edit the values in [`src/config.ts`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/src/config.ts) based on the guidance in the type documentation on this website and open a pull request in [`ubclaunchpad/new`](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new). Your changes will be automatically deployed when your pull request is accepted and merged!

If something you want to change cannot be updated with `config.ts`, refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/new/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed documentation.
